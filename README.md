# Satisfactorisimo
A satisfactory save game for sharing
This directory goes into (by default) C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\FactoryGame\Saved\SaveGames\
I'm not sure if you just unpack it into what looks like a randomly named directory? Unpack it with this directory into your SaveGames and see if that works. I can remove that if it's not needed...
